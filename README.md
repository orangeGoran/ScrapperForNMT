#ScrapperForNMT
This scrapper is used to check correctness of NMT translation, which is based on neuralmonkey.

To run scrapper type: node scrapper.js

For translations on backend I am using https://github.com/orangeGoran/neuralmonkey-experiments with running neuralmonkey server. Please check their documentation for more information and tutorial.
